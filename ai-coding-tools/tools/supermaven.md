## Open Source

## Installation

Use the official installation instructions — do not rely on third-party copies:

- [Official install/setup docs](https://supermaven.com/)

## Basic Usage

Start from the official quickstart in the documentation above. Keep the first session read-only (or on a scratch repository) until you trust the tool's file-editing and terminal behavior.

## Agent Workflow

```text
Prompt
 ↓
Context gathering (repository / MCP tools)
 ↓
File changes
 ↓
Human review
 ↓
Final changes
```

Only the steps above are supported by this tool (derived from the capability table, not marketing claims).

## Strengths

Latency, 1M context, style adaptation.

## Weaknesses

Autocomplete/chat only; no autonomous agent.

## Best For

Fast inline completions with very large context.

## Not Ideal For

- Developers who need stability guarantees — Supermaven changes quickly; re-verify features and pricing before committing.
- Anyone unwilling to review generated diffs and terminal commands.

## Security Considerations

Agents that execute terminal commands and edit files can cause damage if misused. Review diffs before accepting, never paste secrets into prompts, keep permissions scoped. See [AI coding security](../docs/security/ai-coding-security.md).

## Privacy Considerations

With BYOK/local models, prompts go to the provider you choose (or nowhere for local). Hosted products may retain data per their policy — verify the current policy before using on proprietary code. See [privacy notes](../docs/security/privacy.md).

## Student Perspective

Assessment: **good** — see [best tools for students](../comparisons/best-for-students.md).

## Ali's Setup

Verdict for HP EliteBook 845 G7 (Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U, 8 GB RAM, no dGPU, Windows, VS Code, PowerShell): **Good**

Works well on this machine for normal use. Stated requirements: Any..
